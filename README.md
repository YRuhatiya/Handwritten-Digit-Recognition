# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

- This is a mini-project for training a **neural network** to recignise handwritten digits.
- I used the **MNIST** database for training and testing the model.
- Utilised Tensorflow, Keras, NumPy libraries for developing and testing the model

The neural network developed has 2 hidden layers with ReLU activation and the final layer has softmax activation for the **multiclass classification**.
